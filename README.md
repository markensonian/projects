Project 2 has to do with making a database and manipulating data. I customized it to certain customers and based on other information. This way, more focus could be placed on certain customers' needs.

Project 1 has to do with drawing the database outline. I designed it so it would be a basic standard database. This is the foundation.

Project 3 has me research and talk about things such as Bitcoin. I talked about how back when the project was made originally, SQL was not flawless and so had a problem or two. This would get sympathy from the professor.

Cis 310 has me use Salesforce and talk to see how it could be used. I got over 110% for this project. It basically has me go over Salesforce fundamentals to use on customers.

Conflict project has me talking about a real estate negotiation. I used the methods of communication I learned and negotiated. The goal was achieved.

Business 14 project has me do a financial analysis on the pros and cons of getting a Valhalla car. It was tough and long (as is the nature of STEM) using Google Sheets and Word but in the end, I finished the analysis and realized I could not afford the car.

Business 11 has me talk about electric cars. It was successful in how it was delivered as I found myself talking about the environment a lot though, part of this was on video.

Promotional project has me and a team talk about how an organization can be better marketed. We talked about how using different social media sites for different purposes would have an impact. Of course, it worked out and more people got involved online and in person.
